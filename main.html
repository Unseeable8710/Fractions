			Introduction: Fractions
		</h1>
		<p>
		Fractions are smaller parts of a number that can add up to the whole that it started with.
		Here's an example:
		1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1
		There, you're adding 4 fourths to make one whole.
		Let's try another one:
		1/2 + 1/2 = 1
		Here, you are adding 2 halves to make one whole.
