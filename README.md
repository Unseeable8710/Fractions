# Fractions
> ## About this project
> 1. #### This is a Chrome extention called "Fractions for Kids".  
> 2. #### I lost my password for the account that I used to use to make it, so I somehow found the code on my computer and I renamed it to "Fractions".
> 3. #### This isn't an extention yet, and I might rename it to "Math". Idk yet
